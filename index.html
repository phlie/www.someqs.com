                     <h2>What Is Quantum Computing?</h2>
                     <h3>An Introduction</h3>
                     <p>Quantum Computing is a new field of engineering that although it shares many similarities to traditional computing, it differs in its fundamental characteristic. Whereas traditional computing stores and manipulates bits, which can be thought of as either a 1 or a 0, Quantum Computing uses something called a Qubit as its primary component of computation. The main difference being that a Qubit can be either a 1 or a 0 when measured but can also take on any space between a 1 or a 0.</p>
                     <p>For example, a Qubit in a superposition state, when measured using a classical computer register, can give the result of 8 ones and 2 zero. This means that a single Qubit can be used to represent more information than a traditional computer bit. At its base, traditional computing has its bits stored as electrical signals. Quantum Computers, on the other hand, store and manipulate their information using Quantum properties of matter, which stems from our understanding of Quantum Physics.</p>
                     <h3>What Is Quantum Physics?</h3>
                     <p>Quantum Physics is the theory and study of how small amounts of matter and light behave. It differs from Classical Mechanics in that the equations that govern individual particles of matter, differ drastically from Newtonian Physics. Some of the main properties of Quantum Physics are so strange indeed that Scientists and Philosophers are still trying to determine what the nature of reality actually is, but, if we put aside the nature of reality, we have very accurate mathematical models of the Quantum World.</p>
                     <p>The stranger aspects of Quantum Physics are that a particle, until measured, has a position that is not actually precise with regards to its position. Instead, we can derive an equation that predicts its probability of being in a certain location when it is finally measured. Another property of Quantum Physics is that one entangled particle can interact with its partner particle when neither are in the same location. There are many other properties of Quantum Physics, such as a particles orientation determines how it interacts with other particles, but we will not get into that here.</p>
                     <h3>What Is A Qubit?</h3>
                     <p>A Qubit is a particle, or something of the sort, that is used to make up the computational structure of Quantum Computers. It has many properties that are best described in math, but can be represented as something called a Bloch Sphere. When you represent a Qubit as a Bloch Sphere, the values that the Qubit will have when measured are represented as all the possible points on the surface of the sphere. At the top of the sphere, you have the |0> position. If the Qubit is in the |0> position, when measured it will have the output of a 0. In the |1>
it will have an output of 1. The interesting properties of a Qubit comes from when it is in a superposition state and outputs a combination of 1's and 0's in the form a|0> + b|1> where a and b stand for the amount of 0's and 1's. In simpler terms, the Qubit can be thought of as representing a combination of 1's and 0's.</p>
                     <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                     <p>What can Quantum Computers actually do? Many academics have purposed numerous things a Quantum Computer can compute that a traditional computer never could. Now, with the first programmable Quantum Computers coming online, many theorists are able to test their algorithms on a real machine. We believe, that Quantum Computing is going to be an interesting field to be involved in due to its novel nature. Where it will lead, we don't really know, but we do think it will lead to many advancements in fields predicted, and fields not predicted, and possibly in fields that have not yet been thought of. Staying on the cutting edge of technology is our goal, welcome to someQs, we are building something quantum.</p>
